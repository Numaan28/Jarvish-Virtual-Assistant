# Jarvish-Virtual-Assistant
Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant that interacts with users through voice commands. It uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture spoken input and `pyttsx3` to give voice responses. Jarvis can perform various tasks like opening websites (Google, YouTube), telling the current time, answering basic questions, and even telling jokes to keep interactions fun. A key feature of this assistant is its ability to search the web using the `wikipedia` and `requests` libraries. For instance, if the user asks, “Who is Shahrukh Khan?”, Jarvis fetches and reads out a short summary from Wikipedia. It also uses the NewsAPI to deliver the latest news headlines on request. The assistant runs continuously in a loop, listening and responding to commands while handling errors if the voice input isn’t clear. Basic Q\&A responses are pre-programmed to make the assistant more interactive. This project is great for beginners in Python as it teaches how to work with APIs, speech processing, and automation. Jarvis demonstrates how multiple Python modules can be integrated to build a smart, voice-enabled application. It can be further improved with features like email automation, weather reports, and integration with AI models like ChatGPT for smarter conversations.
